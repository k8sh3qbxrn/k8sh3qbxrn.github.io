  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <li>My name is Arianna, or Ari, she/her, 18, and I've been making video edits for almost 5 years (est. June 11th 2018)</li>
  <li>I've used After Effects since June 2019 (I used it just for coloring and effects until October 2019, when I finally learned some transitions). Prior to that, I used Videostar</li>
  <li>I've been interested in Classic Hollywood since I was young, and it was through editing that I managed to find others and expand that interest</li>
  <li>Through editing, I've found so many more films, people, and works, and it's seriously influenced my life</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Usernames (and what they meant):</h3>
<body> On November 29th 2018, I made my first editing Instagram, and thus, this began the long list of my usernames:</body>
</ul>
  <li>iconeditz.videostar</li>
  <li>iconseditz.vs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bvrgvndymp4old/">bvrgnvdy.mp4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bvrgvndymp4">bvrgnvdymp4</a></li>
  <li>mqneytrees (my old youtube username)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdSjzffclsoeTtIDsIxINmA">k8sh3qbxrn</a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/k8sh3qbxrn/">(I did have an instagram account where I posted one edit but then got anxious about posting edits on instagram lol)</a> </li>
  <h4>As for their meaning:</h4>
  <li>iconeditz.videostar / iconseditz.vs -> I literally made this up on the spot.</li>
  <li>bvrgnvdy.mp4 / bvrgvndymp4 -> burgundymp4 -> my favorite color is burgundy.</li>
  <li>mqneytrees -> moneytrees -> from "Money Trees" by Kendrick Lamar, one of my favorite songs.</li>
  <li>k8sh3qbxrn -> kateshepburn -> based off of Katharine, or Kate, Hepburn, my favorite actress and probably the person I've edited the most.</li>
</ul>

<h3>So where can I find your edits?:</h3>
<body> You can click the links in the previous section, the bvrgvndymp4old account has edits from November 2018 to October 2019, and the bvrgvndymp4 account is from October 2019 to May 2020. On my YouTube I have some edits from later in 2020 and then one from 2021, and some of my favorites from 2022 onward, I don't post every edit I make. </body>
<h4>Is there an edit archive for the ones that you didn't post?</h4>
<body> I would make one, but I don't really know how to go back and find the credits for audios, coloring, overlays, etc retroactivly. </body>
