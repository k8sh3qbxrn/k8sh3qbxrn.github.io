  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <li>My name is Arianna, or Ari, she/her, 18, and I've been making video edits for almost 5 years (est. June 11th 2018)</li>
  <li>I've used After Effects since June 2019 (I used it just for coloring and effects until October 2019, when I finally learned some transitions). Prior to that, I used Videostar</li>
  <li>I've been interested in Classic Hollywood since I was young, and it was through editing that I managed to find others and expand that interest</li>
  <li>Through editing, I've found so many more films, people, and works, and it's seriously influenced my life</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Usernames (and what they meant):</h3>
<body> On November 29th 2018, I made my first editing Instagram, and thus, this began the long list of my usernames:</body>
</ul>
  <li>iconeditz.viderostar</li>
  <li>iconseditz.vs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bvrgvndymp4old/">bvrgnvdy.mp4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bvrgvndymp4">bvrgnvdymp4</a></li>
  <li>mqneytrees</li>
  <li><a href="url">k8sh3qbxrn</a></li>
  <h4>As for their meaning:</h4>
  <li>iconeditz.viderostar / iconseditz.vs -> I literally made this up on the spot.</li>
  <li>bvrgnvdy.mp4 / bvrgvndymp4 -> burgundymp4 -> my favorite color is burgundy.</li>
  <li>mqneytrees -> moneytrees -> from "Money Trees" by Kendrick Lamar, one of my favorite songs.</li>
  <li>k8sh3qbxrn -> kateshepurn -> based off of Katharine, or Kate, Hepburn, my favorite actress and probably the person I've edited the most.</li>
</ul>
