    <ul>
      <li>My name is Arianna, or Ari, she/her, 18, and I've been making video edits for almost 5 years (est. June 11th 2018)</li>
      <li>I've used After Effects since June 2019 (I used it just for coloring and effects until October 2019, when I finally learned some transitions). Prior to that, I used Videostar </li>
      <li>I've been interested in Classic Hollywood since I was young, and it was through editing that I managed to find others and expand that interest. </li>
      <li>Through editing, I've found so many more films, people, and works, and it's seriously influenced my life. </li>
      <li>On November 29th, 2018, I made my first editing Instagram account, all of my user names were: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>@iconeditz.videostar</li>
          <li>@iconeditz.vs</li>
          <li>@iconseditz.vs</li>
          <li>@bvrgvndy.mp4 (this account is still up on instagram it's calld @bvrgvndymp4old)</li>
          <li>@bvrgvndymp4 (still up on instagram)</li>
          <li>@mqneytrees (my old youtube channel name)</li>
          <li>@k8shxqbxrn (there is an instagram by that name with one edit, but I decided I didn't want to post on instagram)</li>
