  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <li>My name is Arianna, or Ari, she/her, 18, and I've been making video edits for almost 5 years (est. June 11th 2018)</li>
  <li>I've used After Effects since June 2019 (I used it just for coloring and effects until October 2019, when I finally learned some transitions). Prior to that, I used Videostar</li>
  <li>I've been interested in Classic Hollywood since I was young, and it was through editing that I managed to find others and expand that interest</li>
  <li>Through editing, I've found so many more films, people, and works, and it's seriously influenced my life</li>
</ul>
